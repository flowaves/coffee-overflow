# Coffee Overflow
Inspired by the hangman game, except that the hangman is replaced by an overflowing coffee, a reference to **[Le caf√© des devs](https://discord.gg/cafedesdevs) server ;)**


The goal of the game is to guess the word by proposing letters **before the coffee overflows !**


The words are related to **the world of programming**.


Let's find out if you're a true dev or not ;)


**Good luck !**

### There are three difficulty modes
1. **Expresso** (hard)

2. **Standard** (balanced)
